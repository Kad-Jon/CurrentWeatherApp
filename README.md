Demo forecast app using DarkSky API

This is a project I worked on to consolodate and further familiarize construction of API Calls via basic URLSession tasks. The API I use
to retrieve the forecast data is the DarkSky API. For the purposes of this project I also began to learn how to work with the 
MapKit library, allowing for the user to search for locations they wish to see the forecast for.
